#Outlook Mettings

This project aims to create a web application which will help us to book meeting rooms in any organization or for personal use. User can specify the members which needs to attend the meeting or the number of percentage people must be available for particular meeting. User can set start and date and time and time duration to find available time slots and locations for meetings.

### Features will be included like 
1.  Suggestions of time slots and location based on conditions.
2.  Autocomplete email addressing.
3.  Create groups of people for future referencing( stored searches).
4.  Machine learning suggestions of people based on history and user behaviour. 
5.  It will allow to book meetings by single click.
